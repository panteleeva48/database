0,AAl_13_1,best,./data/exam2014/AAl_13_1,"The presented data shows us the percentage of people aged 65 and over in three different countries (USA, Sweden and Japan) in the second half of the 20th century and up to 2040. But what factory make the figures so varied?
First of all, it is the average length of life. Japan is well-known for its long-living people , and that is why the proportion of them is expected to excud 25% by 2040. However, the economic situation has not always been so brilliant , moreover, it was much worse there then in Europe and America , so the number was relatively low until the expected acute rise in 2030. Also, that is due to the fact that more children are born in Japan , and as a result, they take up some 'space' in the generations division. 
Secondly, it is social policy that afects the quality of life. After the introduction of state insurance and pensions both in the USA and Sweden , more elderly people were able to afford suitable medical treatment, housing or other benefits. Another option is the decline in the number of children per family. More and more young people decline to start a family later anf have only 1 or 2 offsprings , and this tendency will certainly bring about the growth of the proportion of the elderly people, as those born in 1975 are 65 years old by 2040.
To draw a conclusion, we may say that not only social or economic tendencies , but also government policies might cause certain changes in social proportions , consequently, these policies and tendencies should be accurately governed.

1,AAl_27_1,best,./data/exam2014/AAl_27_1,"The graph provides data about the percentage of group of people 65 years old and over. It demonstrates a change of this proportion from 1940 to 2040 in Japan, Sweden and USA.
It's clear from the graph that in every compacative country the quantity of people 65 years old and over would increase from 5%-10% in 1940 to 25% approximately in 2040. However, the ways of growing are different. The percentage of population aged 65 and over in USA is guaducelly increasing during this 100 years like in Sweden. By contrast , Japan's group of people 65 years old and over had been decreasing from 1940 to 1983 approximately, then it began to rise slightly and in 2030 there would be drammatic increase from 10% to 25%. In USA and Sweden there were periods of decline too - from 1980 to 1990 and from 1980 to 2014 respectively. Moreover, next period of decrease of population aged 65 and over is expected in USA in 2015.
As a result of change Japan will be the oldest country in 2040, then Sweden and USA respectively. It means that Japan will be in risk of demography problems.

The population aged 65 and over from Japan was only 5 percent in 1940. Then there was slightly decrease for 20 years period and it was a constant next 20 years . After 1980 it become to increase slightly. According to graph this increase will be continued and in 2030 will go up dramatically to 25 percent.
In Sweden the number of people in 1940 was about 7 percent. Between 1940 and 1980 this number was increasing. After that there was slight fall and than sharp rise. The same situation will be between 2010 and 2040. The numbers will reach almost 25 percent.
In the USA there were almost 10 percent aged people in 1940. Between 1940 and 1980 it was a little more than in Sweden . After 1980 the indicators were stable and after 2020 will rise to 23 percent in 2040.
To sum up, it can be seen from the graph, the number of people aged 65 and over increase and will reach the number nearly 25 percent to 2040 in all countries.

	Due to the charts, UK residents travelled to the other countries more than overseas residents visited UK. Moreover, there were two most visited countries by the English which were Spain and France.
To look more precisely at the first chart, there was slight difference between numbers of UK travelers and foreign travelers in 1979, which accounted approximately 13 millions and 10 millions respectively. This difference had increased substantially by 1999, making up to 28 millions and 54 millions respectively.
Due to the information about the most preferred countries by the English in 1999, the most popular ones were France and Spain which are visited by 11 millions and 8 millions people. USA was the third most visited country (roughly 4 million of people), while Greece and Turkey were the forth and fifth ones (3 millions and 2 millions respectively).

The first visible trend can be found if we compare the growth dynamics of elderly population in Sweden and USA. In 1940 the percentage of these people in USA was close to 10% while in Sweden it was about 7%. From then on the figures of these countries grew steadily until 1995. In that year the percentage of population aged aged 65 and over rocketed in Sweden hitting the maximum point of 20% while the same trend stayed in USA. It is predicted that their percentages will narrow in the 2020’s but the USA will not be able to keep up with Sweden.

Up until the early 2000’s the percentage of elderly people in Japan was fluctuating, falling to the lowest point between 1960 and 1980. But then it grew steadily and it is highly possible that it will rise sharply up to more than 25% in 2040.

Overall it is clear that while Sweden and USA share the same trend features, Japan, after the years of low percentage rates, will catch up on other countries.

In Japan, the proportion of elderly people is the lowest out of three countries and stays under 5% up until the beginning of the 2000s. However, there is an upward trend since the end of the 1990s. In 2030 the procentage line goes up almost vertically and reaches the maximum of roughly 27% by 2040.

The USA and Sweden rising trends are similar with insignificant differences until the end of the 1990s. The rate of the increase changes by approaching the new century. The USA figures grow slowly and steadily after 2020 with the «plato» period of 20 years before that. Sweden people aged 65 and over experience a sharper increase with dramatic fluctuations, joining the consequential rise after 2020.

The overall tendency is the increase of the number of the elderly people to the population of the country in general. In Sweden and USA the original proportion of the elderly people doubles, while the Japan figure rises in 5 times.

First, let’s take a look at the ages of population of both countries in 2000. Almost a half of Yemens population is taken over by the children from 0 to 14 years, while this age group in Italy covers only 14%. The other half of Yemens population consists of 46% of adults and only 4% of elderly people. However, in Italy adults present the biggest part in population – almost 62%. And the elder part is not small too.
Then, looking at 2050 pie charts for both countries, we can see that the elder population in Yemen will not increase much, while in Italy there will be almost twice more elders. The number of people aged 0-14 years in Yemen will considerably decrease, leaving place for adult population, which will grow up by 11%.
To sum up, we can clearly see that Yemen has tendency to have more young population, while Italy has more representatives of elder age groups. And in 50 years the ages of population of both countries will change consequently.

National and international calls have a steady increase in the number of call minutes throughout the period, paining about 2-5 billions a year. Local fixed line calls had a peak in 1999, steadily rising until this year and starting to lose positions at almost the same rate after.
In general, we can see an increase in total number of call minutes, and mobile calls have became significantly more popular in 2002 than in 1995, while other types of calls have ether a relatively moderate increase, as national/international telephone calls, or maintaining almost the same number of minutes in 2002 as in 1995 (local fixed line calls).

The last one is given as passengers per year and it is counted in millions of people.
From the table we see that, out of six cities, London was the first to have its own underground railway system. It was opened in 1863 and now it is also the one with the longest route, which counts up to 394 kilometers of tracks. However, it's passenger density is not the biggest and it is less than half of the same parameter of Tokyo, where the number of passengers per year reaches 1927 millions. This is despite the fact, that there length of route sums up to only 155 kilometers.

The length of these systems in Paris, Tokyo and Washington DC fluctuates from 100 to 200 kilometres while the longest route is situated in London (394 kilometres). However, the system of Koyoto and Los Angeles are really short. Moreover, the underground railway system of Tokyo is the busiest one because 1927 million of passengers visit it every year.

Generally speaking, the total amount of such children decreased in every region. Still, Africa has the highest rates in 2012, as well as in 2000. Also it is noticeable that in both years there were more girls without access to primary school then boys, despite the fact that in 2012 everywhere but in Africa the situation was the opposite (more boys without such access). The most dramatic changes took place in South Asia, where the number of these children fell down by more then 3 times form 32,7 millions to 9,9 which is the lowest rate in 2012. What is interesting, the number of girls dropped by nearly 4,5 times, whereas the number of boys declined only by 50 per cent.

12,AAl_2_2,best,./data/exam2014/AAl_2_2,"Due to the principles of the International law there could not be any discrimination. So, males and females have equal rights nowadays in all spheares of life. This rule also concerns educational process their all people have a right to have an education, besides, they are free to choose any subject they want. Moreover, is it appropriate for universities to accept  males and females in every subject equaly?
First of all, if we speak of equality of men and women we should make a notice that this also mean that women could not do some work which is not suit them (take heavy things). In other ways it is known that females can choose freely their profession. Secondly, we can easily think of jobs which will be more priority for males such as military professions.
What is the goal of setting the rule when universities accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject? Will it really provide equality? It is set by the laws that everyone has an opportunity to study the subject he prefers. This rule is enough for the realisation of the principle mentioned above.
Another factor which may be set against that rule is a different propostion of population of males and females in the country. It would be hard to reach equal numbers because women simply can be more than men or overwise, so this argument makes that rule almost impossible.
Of course universities may try to bistribute makes and females during educational process in different groups equaly and that probably will bring positive result. 
To sum up, everyone both males and females has a right and opportunity to choose their profession and study in a place they want. It will not be appropriate for university workers trying to choose students by the criteria of equality of males and females instead of professional qualities and knowledge, which may have every person. 
"
13,AAl_13_2,best,./data/exam2014/AAl_13_2,"The question of gender equality in all spheres of social life has become very hotly discussed in the resent decades. One of the most important factors that constitute a future professional 'profile' of every individual is, of course, higher education. Providing society with strictly similar numbers of male and female graduates in each subject would certainly change the labour market as well as academic world. But will these changes be for the better - or for the worse?
The first point to fear in mind is that nowadays students are accepted on the basis of their performance during entrance examinations. That means: only previous qualifications and / or knowledge of each applicant is taken into consideration. Is it fair to give preferences to this or that young person because of their race, religion or gender? No, this will mean discrimination , and that is the inevitable consequence of 'gender-based' intake of students.
Extremely alike reform has been carried out in Germany. The universities are obliged to hold different entrance lists for man and women with different entrance marks. As a result, it may be easier for a male to gain acceptance to a medical school (with 1.3 entrance mark in comparison with female 1.1). I do not think that is 'fairness' in the proper sense of this word.
The only aspiration of this reform I agree with is the feeling that certain fields of science or work are traditionally 'male' or 'female'. Although I don't believe that 'maxing' of sexes should be caused by such a radical method , I think that young girls and boys should be encouraged to take up any profession they are into, no matter if it is supposed to be men- or women-only occupation. 
"
14,AAl_26_2,best,./data/exam2014/AAl_26_2,"Today there is a great number of discussions about male/female relationships. One of them is should male and female students work together and even more - in equal numbers. Some people lelieve that it's inappropriate , to make universities accept equal numbers of male/female students, others agree that it will improve current situation in education. 
There exist strong arguments of both sides of this disscussion, which implies that it is worth examining all points of view before reaching any conclusion. 
First of all, there is a necesity to say that one of the advantages of these type of accepting students is the equallity between men and women. Equall numbers mean equall opportunities for people, without discrimination sexes. Moreover, there is a plenty of scientist's researchs convincing that working between male and female groups of people in equall proportions gives a much more favor. Also, this type of proportion helps members of each group interact with others easily, that when there is a disproportion.
Another point of view is that such type of accepting students is useless and pointless. Supporters claim that such thing can destroy the real competition between students, which is based on knowledge, not on female / male you are or not.
Another drawback of equall accepting numbers is that it can crushed all system of university's academic freedom - government will give concrete numbers of students , who schould study in universities. And one of the most convincing arguments againts equall proportions between male/female students is that there is no any correlation or connection between knowledge and which sex do you have. And I am firmly believe in that. Since the Medievel times, people fight against discrimination, for modern society with equall rights for everybody. And for the first time, this meosure for accepting equall numbers of students seems like justice, lut it is not real suitable criteria for competition between students. There is no shame if men are good at law and women in teaching as there is no any discrimination between them in case of disproportion.
Considering all arguments , it can be concluded that the idea of universities accepting equal number of male / female students is not good of all.
"
15,AAl_27_2,best,./data/exam2014/AAl_27_2,"There is an opinion that universities should consist of equal parts of men and women, because society should give the same rights and possibilities for both sex. I can't agree with this opinion.
Firstly, undulation should not depend on sex. The main criteria is personal abilities and way of thinking. If universities had accepted equal quantity of students in 16-19 centuries despite of their mental activity, modern society would never have industrial machines, planes and cues just because young scientist , who had innovating ideas , were not accepted university.
Secondly, there are a lot of professions which require some physical or psychological features from warheas. It depends on character of work, its aims and audience. For example, it's really difficult for men to work at women's consultation centre because both doctor or client would be embarrassed. Besides, women would have problems working as machinery operator because sometimes, it's necessary to repair huge machines quickly to prevent the catastroph. The majority of women just do not have such strong organism and muscles.
Thirsty, such equality would negatively affect not only a person, who was not accepted by university , but also a person , who was. It would happen because student of university will be scere that employes would accept them equally like the university. However, such students do not pay attention for the fact that employers will take the smartest students. As a result of this equality students lose their ability for competition.
All in all, university is ""a factory"" of knowledges, research and new inventions. We should not create barriers for ahibitious persons and accept persons, who doesn't have interest in education, just because of sex equality. If it would happen, the development of science and society's culture will stop.

16,VKo_2_2,best,./data/exam2014/VKo_2_2,"One of the inevitable human rights is freedom of speech. Considering any form of art a way to speak about something hardly anyone can make any restrictions without breaking the essential human rights. Meanwhile I think it is necessary to give all the freedom to any artist, it still seems fair to me that piece of art can somehow hurt other people, so the government restrictions can be used only for protection but not for limiting one's will to express himself.
Due to the fact that contemporary art is developing and becoming more and more extraodinary, some people can say that the government should restrict such perfomance that can somehow hurt feeling of other people. The scandalous organisation ""Pussy Riot"", which had punk pray in the cathedral, is still being discussed. All the people are divided into two fighting groups; one is proclaiming that this perfomance is a form of modern art aimed to express the political protest, and another group is sure that the punk pray is nothing but only an attempt to hurt the feelings off religious people and descrinate the faith. However, freedom of people to express their own is a constitutionally proclaimed right of everyone so no one can be deprived of it. More to say, throughout the centuries all the artists (musicians, painters, poets) have struggled for their freedom to be heard.
Therefore, it seems to me like it is not the government who can somehow restrict the artists' freedom to express themselves. The only rules that can somehow be excercised must be created only by the common will of society, so these rules will become some moral orientiers for artists in order to make it more easy to distinguish where the expression of themselves can hurt anyone else.
"
17,VKo_3_2,best,./data/exam2014/VKo_3_2,"There is an opinion that creative people like artists, writers and so on should have the freedom to express their ideas in whichever way they may wish and governments should not barrier their activities.
As for me, this point of view is absolutely wrong. First of all, if governments allow people who call themselves artists to express themselves in whichever may they like, that will provide an unstoppable chaos because than anyone just by proclaiming that he is an artist will have a liberty to do whatever he likes calling his actions an art. Furthermore, I believe that governments should provide order and order  is only achieves by control. Governments which can't provide control may lose a respect of their citizens and, which is much worse, legitimacy. For example, last year one so called artist clipres his testicles to the ground at the Red square as an act of protest against Russian government. As for me, I doubt that this is an acceptable way of self-expression.
There is an another argument: providing such freedom to artists conpredicts the basic principles of the democracy. According to the liberal position, no group should have preferences in their social rights, everybody must be equal, no mater who those people are: buisinessmen, labors or artists. If society gives preferences to some group they means that this group may avoid rules which influences freedom.
In conclusion, I'd live to state one more time that artists should not be out of restrictions on what they do because it is immoral and unfair to other social groups and also because this may put society in a dangerous situation.
"
18,VKo_5_2,best,./data/exam2014/VKo_5_2,"Some people argue that creative artists are given too much freedom nowadays, while others think that self-expression can't be limited with any kinds of rules. I suppose that artists should be able to create whatever they want. Nevertheless there have to be some restrictions related to showing it publicly.
First of all, some artists don't have any boundaries and a lot of people love their works. However, these pieces of art can be harmful for children, because they are very sensitive and they percept everything they see. That's why it's reasonable to prohibit children to watch some films, visit some exhibitions and listen to some pieces of music.
Secondly, I have mentioned earlier that these restrictions should not be too serious. It means that artists should have their right to create anything they want. If a child gets access to prohibited pieces of art it's not the fault of an artist.
Also I believe that the grown-ups are able to decide themselves whether to read a book or not, whether to go to an exhibition or not. Even if they are shocked by the way an artist expresses himself they can deal with it. That's why the adults shouldn't not be restricted from getting acquomted with this or that piece of art. The only limit has to be the dignity of other people. I think that it concerns some kinds of installations.
All in all, it seems to me that people are free to express themselves. On the other hand, they need to remember that they are not the only ones who will see their creations. The restrictions are to focus on protection of children and dignity of other people and not on some political matters. These restrictions should not be similar to censorship.
"
19,VKo_9_2,best,./data/exam2014/VKo_9_2,"Nowadays the question of self-expression is being widely discussed, because of spreading the government restrictions on it in Russia. To my mind, there should not be official restrictions from our government, but there should be inner moral rules about what somebody can or cannot do.
Firstly, I have to say that nobody can stop our imagination creating different ideas, and government restrictions will not make us do it. They can only make some types of arts illegal, but it does not mean that these types of arts will die out. If government gives us freedom to express our ideas, there will be more orginized events and festivals. In this way government will show that it trusts it's nation.
But I should notice that some types of arts cannot be shown to the children, because it may hurt their feelings or minds or be really unacceptable for this little age. I want to say that we should protect young consiousness from harmfull effect.
Besides, I believe that expressing and watching are different things, that we cannot combine in our discussion. I guess that everybody has a right to express what he thinks or feels, but everytime a person should remember that he can upset his relatives or friends. Everybody has different views on music, politics, art. We should be tollerant and respect an opposite point of view.
To sum it all up I want to say that everybody has to dicide for himself if he can express something, which is inside of him, or cannot. For me, it is more important to have inner restrictions than have useless government rules which try to control our modern art.
"
20,VKo_12_2,best,./data/exam2014/VKo_12_2,"They say creative people should be free to express their creativity in any way they want.
In my personal opinion culture and art is certainly an inceporable peace of our everyday life. So those who create genuine art are [ir?]tal for the soeciety to develope in the right direction. Though, creative artists are obviously should feel free to express themself in all ways of art like literature, cinema, painting etc., they still should have some moral boundaries, not necessary provided by government. I do believe that everyone should know the difference between expressing themselves and total limitless egoism. Especially when those artist want the audience to see or to hear their masterpience. What I mean is art can not be associated with insulting others, making harm to others even if the Creator suppose it is how He sees the world. For example, a famous singer is writing a rude song about his enemy or a person he just dislikes. As soon as the people hear this song, they will have prejudices against this person without even knowing him/her.
Moreover, sometimes so-called art can have some inappropriate content, it can be inappropriate for children, for instance. This is when the government can interfere and put some age restrictions.
All in all, I understand that artist are free spirits, though I still stick to the idea that the genuine (which is very important) art and the rules of morality and tolerance should compromise in order to prevent chaos and misunderstanding.
"
21,VKo_21_2,best,./data/exam2014/VKo_21_2,"Creativity is the sphere, which might always be free from government and law restrictions in reason to be able to express artists' own view on art. To what degree it is true?
From my point of view, the art is a personal and intimate phenomene. That is why creative artists should be free from limits and boundaries. The main argument in favor is that It represents art trends and tendendies of modern generation. This cause leads us to another reason. Freedom in art expression helps present art to create the history. There is no doubt, that government restrictions erode genuine creativity and make current art biased.
On the other hand, some people believe, that power limitations will help to control expressions of modern art, because sometimes it is neccessary. There are a lot of examples, when products of some creative artist over-step the law. Moreover, some art expressions break the moral  principles by propaganding non-ethic (sometimes violent) ideas. However, I tend to think, that such activity and its different, non-typical views seem to be only another, distinguished lifestyle, which doesn't mean immoral expressions, but conceptual.
In conclusion, I would like to stress, that creative artists will always exists, and different opinions on freedom of their expressions will also exist. However, It's up to you to decide, what to think about it.
"
22,VKo_24_2,best,./data/exam2014/VKo_24_2,"Nowadays, there are many heated debates about whether government restrictions should exist and control what creative artists are allowed to do or whether we should give freedom to those artists to express in a way they want. Personally, I absolutely agree with the first point of view due to some reasons.
First of all, to my mind, it is absolutely important to control every sphere of our life, if it is not under a certain amount of control, there would be a disaster. Consequently, by giving the freedom to creative artists to express themselves as they want will definitely lead to certain problems. For instance, it would be almost impossible to keep an eye on a censure, because some artists have got an extraordinary views on art.
Secondly, many unofficial films, pictures etc. will appear. Hence, it would be veryhard to control this big flow of pirate movies, not officially recorded songs. Therefore, it will lead to more people who break the rules and the rate of crime will grow.
On the other hand, many people may say that we have to think about the freedom of expression. While speaking about this theme. Although this opinion makes sense, little to these people realize how many disadvantages will appear when government restrictions are off.
To reteirate my point of view, I do believe that everything in this world should be under the control of something whether it is government or parents, because without restrictions we will not be able to live a sedate life.
"
23,VKo_29_2,best,./data/exam2014/VKo_29_2,"Many years ago government could punish some creative people when their ideas did not support power's way of managerment. Today artists have the freedom, but sometimes government can restrict their ideas. I am convinced that creative artists should not be restricted.
In my opinion, politics and art do not have the same reasons. The function of government is regulation of social, economical and political relationships in society. Art is another world that gives up an opportunity to think and live as we wish in our fantasies.
If creative persons forget their freedom to express their ideas, we will not see the new kinds and trends of art. Modern life is very dynamic, it changes very fast. Yes, we have many wonderful pictures of 18 century, we can listen to classical music and watch old films. But, despite of it, we need more genius compositions.
We know that some of modern songs, films, cartoons and pictures have the signals of revolution. Power afraid of this trend, because modern art can influence the society more then government. Without any doubt, sometimes it can be useful. Power corrupts. Art is indicator of people's opinion, and people can influence government.
Freedom is a criteria of democracy. Democracy is the main idea of modern life, that is why today everybody can express his ideas the way he wants.
But some people have an opposite viewpoint. They sure that modern painters and singers are very free, that is why their expression is ugly and can influence children and polite people bad way. I think that these people are afraid of changes in modern world.
Art is long, life is short, that is why freedom should be the main criteria of modern art, because we need the new ways of expression.
"
24,VKo_34_2,best,./data/exam2014/VKo_34_2,"That won't be an exagerration to say that art is what makes our life brightful and fills it with beauty and emotions. It often touches upon social problems and a lot of people of art are sure that the main purpose of their activity is to reveal these problems and to draw public attention to them. They are eager to deliver their position and express themselves through art.
However, they often face censorship. Even in the age of Ekaterina the Great it was forbidden to write about the issues those contradict the policy of the monarch. Ekaterina ordered to burn all the the book ""The travelling from St. Petersburg to Moscow"", which depicted the poor life of the peasants. Censorship exanded in the Soviet Union, a lot of information was hidden from the citizens of our country. Even when the Chernobil accident happened not all the inhabitats of Pripyat were informed and evacuated, so it can lead to terrible consequences.
These examples show that a freedom of speech and a freedom to express your ideas are of essential importance. I strongly believe that the government should avoid approving any bills that can restrict people say what they want. Any bill passed for the sake of creating phrames and bourders for journalists, artists, musicians doesn't bring a benefit to the society. Evidently, these measures are aimed at contributing to the strength of the authorities only. The fact is that the restrictions haven't ever been objective. All the views should be expressed, everyone has a right to be heard, and the public is to decide wheather to agree with a person and his opinion or not; not the government should make a decision.
All things considered, I am sure that censorship brings disadvantages to the society only and all the possible views should be presented to the public.

25,ZEv_3_2,best,./data/exam2014/ZEv_3_2,"Nowadays behaviour of students is becoming a burning issue in several schools all over the world. School children neglect many school rules as well as miss a lot of classes. That is a tricky question why it happens and what can be done to improve this situation.
There are several possible reasons for that problem. First of all, the main cause of bad behaviour is teenagers` nature. Children in difficult age are always supposed to protest against rules they do not conform to. There is nothing to do in order to improve that type of nature, but some changes can be done. As far as I am concerned, the most important thing is to give teenage students  to develop culturally by giving them more lessons on arts, culture and so on. At the same time, teachers should understand what is needed for young people and respect their wish to show individuality, to set up their own rules and so on. That type of teachers` behaviour can lead to mutual understanding and improving situation. 
Secondly, one another reason for the problem of bad behaviour us that students are not involved in the process of education and not interested in getting new knowledge. That is a result of boring classes and the fact that children are not informed how they can use that knowledge. That is why students miss classes being sure they are unresourceful. The possible solution for it is to explain them why every course is important and what is the main purpose of it. For instance, as children understand the importance of knowing biology for future doctors, those who want to become a doctor learn it rarely. Moreover, teachers should make their lessons more interactive and capturing. These actions are to assure children not to miss classes and to encourage them to learn, which is likely to result in their behaviour. 
To sum up, I would like to add that some actions are able to be done to improve the situation of bad students` behaviour even if causes are difficult and lie in the very nature of young people.
"
26,EEm_14_2,best,./data/exam2014/EEm_14_2,"With the rise of the popularity of the higher education and the realisation of the number of job opportunities it offers to young people the question of gender division has come to the minds. It is necessary to provide the students of both sexes with an equal amount of places on each faculty, or can some certain gender traits have an impact on that proportion?

In my opinion it is important that the universities provide both male and female students with an equal access to the exams and faculty places. It is clear that nowadays women have become more confident and are not afraid to participate in the competitions with their male counterparts. Right after the 19th century feminist movement women acquired many rights firstly reserved specifically for men, including the right to study. If a woman can study in the chosen field she can make a good career for herself applying her knowledge appropriately.

Also the division of subjects on «male» and «female» ones is quite ridiculous as it doesn’t consider the talents of each given individual. If a man wants to be a poet or a designer or a teacher it doesn’t that he will grow to be less masculine in the same fashion as the woman who chooses to study engineering or mathematics doesn’t lose her femininity. Everyone should be able to follow their dream and the faculty choice is the first step towards its relation.

On the whole I argue that all the universities should decide weather to allow or not each given student to study in the certain subject judging not by their gender but by their knowledge and eagerness.
"
27,EEm_16_2,best,./data/exam2014/EEm_16_2,"There is an opinion, that every subject in the university should be studied by an equal amount of males and females. However, I can’t fully agree with this suggestion.

Originating from feminist studies and the equality of human rights, the idea of splitting university courses in equal male and female parts seems absurd to me. The same rules and demands, imposed on university applications, regardless of the candidate gender, already become a garantee towards fair university choices.

More than that, any university is highly interested in the most talented students, despite the student;s gender. In case university admits the «half and half» proportion for the subjects, it may restrict some gifted applicants from either side.

Next, there are subjects that considered to be traditionally feminine or masculine. For example, there is a clear feminine dominance in the sphere of children’s education: kindergardens and schools, whereas in the labour domains where physical force is required, the preference is given to men. Males and females are different physically and phycologically, thus they suit better for different occupations.

Needless to say that males and females have different social roles as well. The university subjects requires corresponding climate and artificial division in halves won’t serve to the best of the atmosphere. It’s much more interesting to study with people who are encouraged and curious about the subject than with ones that were taken the form the equal proportion.

To sum up, I would like to say that history knows many examples of outstanding scientists of both genders. For the university, the prime concern should be on student’s motivation and eagerness to develop, the gender doesn’t matter. However, the equal conditions of entry and fair competition of candidates is of high importance. The university courses should form naturally, not artificially in order to provide best productivity.

TASK 2
	There is no rout that the main value in everybody's life is heath. However, despite the accessment of heath insuarance and the development of science and medicine, public health is getting worse. Someones claim that it is necessary to rise the number of sport activities at schools and universities. Others argue that this way would not dramatically change the situation and there are other methods to solve the problem.
	On the one hand, sport exercises help people to keep feet and therefore to decline the ability of having health problems. If a person does not pay enough attention to sport, it can lead to obesity and heart diseases. Moreover, sport activities provide good heath and as a result people do not have to spent time on visiting doctors and wasting money on different expensive medicines.
	On the other hand, the problem with public health can not be solved only by increasing the number of sport facilities. The government should transform not education, but health insuarance system. Drinking alcohol and smoking should be forbidden not only among teenagers but also among their adults. The healthy lifestyle are required to become popular with the help of newspapers, television, the Internet and other mass media instruments.
	To draw a conclusion, I am convinced that both view are likely to take into a consideration. In my opinion, improving public health is impossible without strong governments' action. More than that, everyone should be respovsible about his health and try to reduce work pressure and to find time on sport activities.
"
29,KKo_9_2,best,./data/exam2014/KKo_9_2,"Public health has always been an urgent topic. Nowadays when peoples health is affected by different dangers, caused by the development of humanity, this topic is especially problematic. Scientists and politicians have quarelled about the best way to improve public health.
Some people think that creating more sports facilities will help, while others don’t agree with it. In this essay I will discuss different opinions.
As it was written earlier, some people suggest building more sports facilities. They state that more people will visit gyms and swimming pools if there will be more of those. For example, it will be more convenient for some people to go to the local gym than to travel to another side of the city and backwards.
On the other hand, some people say that it is all about encouragement, not convenience and availability. They argue that people should be encouraged to visit sport centers and to watch over their health. If it will be so, governments will not have to spend money on extra sports facilities. Money will be spent on the improvement of healthcare and older sport facilities to make them suit the needs of people.
As far as my opinion is concerned, the main target of any social state is to maintain proper level of health and welfare of it’s people. That’s why not only new sport facilities should be created, but new hospitals and medical centers. Then, to suit the number of these facilities, a lot of professional doctors and medical personnell should be “grown up” in the state’s universities. All these methods will help one state to provide sufficient healthcare for it’s people. All in all, public health, the level of which has lowered through previous decade, should be taken care of. If all the policies I have brought up in this essay will come true, the level of public health will increase and with it, nation’s welfare.

30,KKo_24_2,best,./data/exam2014/KKo_24_2,"There are lots of discussions these days about high school programmes. People want to give their children the best possible education, so they are widely discussing the education standards, programmes and lows, but there is some thinking to be done about events and activities happening outside the class, for example, some people believe that one of compulsory parts of high school education should be a unpaid community service, which involves working for a charity, improving the neighbourhood and other.
In my opinion, having such project as s part of high school education is a really good idea. Students will gain a lot of experience which will help them during their lives, an experience they would never receive in the classroom. They will have a chance to work and communicate with different people, not only gaining useful knowledge and experience, but also improving their socialization and communication skills. This programme would also be benefitable for the charities, which  often don’t have enough people to achieve their goals, and for the whole community in general.
There are also people who don’t want their children to participate in such programmes. Possible reasons for that include these: by the first, such activities may take a lot of time and concentration, thus reducing the quality of education as students will have less time to spend doing homework or revising the material. By the second, some families may be concerned about the fact the service is meant to be unpaid, not allowing students to gain some work experience and earn some money.
In conclusion, the idea to have an unpaid community service as compulsory part of high school programmes seems really appealing to me, because not only students will benefit from these activities, but also the whole community and society.

31,LPo_16_2,best,./data/exam2014/LPo_16_2,"Nowadays some people are sure that men and women must be accepted by universities in equal proportions. On the other hand, some people claim that universities should not take such measures. I totally agree with latter for the following reasons.
To begin with, it is wide known fact that males can succed in certain spheres of knoweledge whereas women – in other. What is meant is that there is a kind of a tendency that men prefer mathematical studies such as engineering, computer science, some IT-branches, while women would rather choose, for instance, social science like sociology or politology; foreign languages and literature. So, it would be wrong to force a man to study sociology if he feels that he might be more satisfied and successful studying math. Some might argue that both males and females become doctors, but I am convinced that, for example, the greatest surgeons are men.
Another point for not establishing such laws is related to future professions of students and their position in social structure of our society. In some kinds of jobs employers are willing to employ only male, for instance, in IT-companies because, as far as it is believed, men are able to manage with analyzing big amount of information, they are more punctual and they could seldom be stressed. Turning to some female professions. It is worth noticing that women are more required in such sorts of jobs like nurcing care, teachers, sometimes writers. According to some stereotypes, women are more emotional, they find it easy to learn and teach. In order to avoid depression and, unemployment, males and females must have choice what job they want to do and then enter the university where no restrictions must be established.
In conclusion, although there are some difficult situation when a person must study the subject they do not want to, I am sure that universities should not limit the number of different gender students because it could lead to huge problems and not balanced labour-market.
"
32,ASt_2_2,best,./data/exam2014/ASt_2_2,"Nowadays, some groups of people consider that higher school should form study groups for different subjects consisted of the same number of male and female students.
	There are many points of view for this question and all of them, to any mind, are meaningful. Basically, all the viewpoints are built on the hypothesils of advantage and disadvantage of inequal number of students of both sex. For this I would highlight a number of reasons. First of all, there are some of researches happened in Stanford`s laboratory of social problems which have shown that group gives a higher results of studying when there is inequal number of students of both sex. Afterwards, having already managerial experience, I can confidently say that  a work group brings higher result while there is a sex disbalance. However, the whole raw of arguments may contradict my viewpoint. So, somebody can claim that the whole psychological climate in sex balanced groups is warmer hence the relationships between members are stronger, so the work made by such a group will be more efficient. One more reason to contradict mu position is to say a couple words about loyality. In groups with equal number this parameter is much higher and significantly influences on the situation in the group.
	In conclusion, I consider that universities should not accept the same number of males and females in every subject. In my opininon, this step would decrease the whole efficiency of study process.

33,ASt_21_2,best,./data/exam2014/ASt_21_2,"Studies conducted recently show that individual qualities, which we were born with, play a major role in our life can not affect it a lot. The idea is that our developement depends much more on own inilide characteristics than on own life experience.
This thought was also a basis for some of Zigmund Fried's ideas, such as a statement that a human is a wolf for another human. He also argued that humans are aggressive species and that villence is a predetorminer part of our nature. Parallel can be drown between the research recent and the thought of the philosopher. I do indeed belive that the qualities we were born with affect own personality, however process of development must be based on the thongs we encounter during own life.
I sleek to the opinion of Jean-Paul Surtre and this ideas about existenuanneleum , which are absolutely opposite to the ones, introduced by Zigmund Freid. This french philosopher made up theory , according to wich people's characters are made by the society , They were brought up in. In his ideas, there is no obstade for people to change their individual ever when they are out of their teenage years. To me this seems more understandable, as there can be really some life-changing experience encountered and this can happen of any stage of life.
As it seems to me, both factors infnenu who we got to become, because everyone in diffenr, even if the persons, which we coupou happened to up, children, who are pretty similar in their personalities may grow up completely different people, because of what they may encounter.
"
34,ASt_34_2,best,./data/exam2014/ASt_34_2,"The qualities of character which we have from the beginning of our life are sometimes considered to be the most important ones. However, some people think that skills that we get through our existence have a stronger influence on our behaviour.
Personally, I believe that out life is changing day by day under the influence of new experiences. For instance, we can not only learn something unknown but also understand what mistakes we made in our past life. Moreover, some special features of our character appear exactly when we gain new knowledge and have completely different experience. These characteristics can be connected to the previous ones which we show in the first years of life after our birth but their whole inner content will be another.
On the other hand, some researchers provides us information that the personality of each man depends on those qualities of the character we are born with. Firstly, they are sure that process of personal development is controlled by those characteristics and they give us our special way of behaviour. As a consecuence, all of our new experiences are influenced by those striking features from the very beginning. Secondly, these people believe that fact that our mind consists not only from the physiology things from the moment of out birth but also some mental and cognitive activity.
All things considered, we can deny that our personality depends on all types of characteristics: both we are born with and we get through having the new experience and gaining knowledge. In my opinion, there is no doubt that the second ones have a stronger influence on out daily life and self-development because every person is changeable and has a tendency to improve himself.

35,13_2,best,./data/best_works/13_2,"Environment pollution and global warming are one of the global problems we are facing today. As aircrafts are contributing to them, there is a suggestion that there should be a reduction of business and leisure air travelling. I totally disagree with that due a couple of reasons.
First of all, we should consider that air travel is the only way to get to distant places within a short period of time. Without it we won’t be able to get to, for example, Australia from Europe without spending weeks to do that. People will become nearly locked in their countries or even cities, if we are speaking about such large countries as Russia. The price on the small amount of tickets that will still be on the market will be too high and nearly noone will be able to afford them. As a result, we won’t travel that far, won’t discover our beautiful planet. As for businessmen, they will loose an ability to make international business as they used to, which will affect the global economy. Also, there are countries, which demand on tourists, but with reduced air travelling they won’t get their baxes, which will affect the level of life there.
Secondly, it’s important to remember that a great amount of pollution is caused by, for instance, cars and there are known ways to solve this problem. We can develop the sphere of electric vehicles, which have the same functionality as the petrol ones. but do not harm the environment. However, nowadays it’s impossible to find a substitute to airplanes, but it doesn’t mean that we should not use them.
To sum up, I don’t find it crutial to reduce the amount of travelling by air, as it will bring considerably bad consequences. We’d better take care of air environment by changing things that pollute it rather then banning or reducing them.
"
36,28_2,best,./data/best_works/28_2,"Although the problem of air transportation is relatively recent, it has already become one of the most canvassing topics in the modern in the modern society and the subject of the heated debate. My strong concern is that new regulations should be passed by authorities so as to out down on the amount of nonessential flights.
To begin with, the fact that emissions from the aircrafts are extremely harmful for the environment is glaringly obvious. With no restrictions on the number of flights, many of which are rather a means of amusement, than a vital necessity, we might soon face an ecological crisis and end up with no shelter for the following generations. Furthermore, the governments should understand that no ‘green’ movement can be an obstacle for those, who do not pay attention to te environmental issues, therefore a law should be passed to stop this. Besides, with a fully implemented system of air travel restrictions and penalties, it would be easier to come up with long-term state programmes for preserving the natural habitat to all it’s inhabitants and citizens.
However, there are people, who disapprove of such an initiative, claiming that the state is trying to set limits to their rights and freedoms. There might be some truth in that still, I believe that everyone should be in charge for the global environmental problems, such as changes in the ozone layer and greenhouse effect, resulting in global warming. With regard to rights’ limitations we should take into account the fact that our rights and freedoms end where the rights of other person start.
Drawing up a conclusion to my thoughts, I would like to stress, that only global efforts of all the people of Earth can open new vista in the face of today’s harsh ecological circumstances, and it is up to the authorities throughout the globe to be trendsetters. Nothing should be taken for granted and the future of our planet is not an exception.

37,2_2,best,./data/best_works/2_2,"Social media usage is on the rise and no are debates as to what its main purpose is, with some claiming it is information and knowledge sharing, and others refuting that sites such as Facebook and VK exist purely for entertainment. In this essay I will examine both of these views followed by a reasoned conclusion.
More and more people use social media websites for educational purposes and thus regard this as the main aim of these sites. Indeed, not only many institutions and organisations have their own pages on social media site with sufficiently full and up-to-date information, but also it can be used by ordinary people as vital news outlet. For instance, during so-called «Black-out», the series of resonant race-related protests aimed at combating unjust police brutality in the USA, social media such as Twitter and Facebook were often the only source of information for people not directly involved in the protests, as the conventional media relayed scarce or incorrect reports.
There is undoubtedly another facet to social media, namely its entertainment value. A wide variety of games, quizes, musical playlists, visual collages etc. can be found on VK or FB any given day. It is because of this facet that many argue that social media should simply entertain, because it is a rare safe haven among a sea of negative information coming from elsewhere. Admittedly, you need only turn on your TV to see a report on a war or other tragedy within a few minutes.
However, it is agreed that social media’s main purpose is after all, relaying information and knowledge. Entertainment value can still be found widely, one could say that the entire modern culture is built on entertainment. With this in mind, social media is unique in that it posseses a rare accessibility quality, usable for the widest array of people and is thus too important to neglect when discussing its information value.
In conclusion, there is no consensus generally as to the main purpose of social media, but it is agreed that sharing information is more vital than mere entertainment as it possesses some unique qualities in this capacity such as accessibility.

Overall, it can be observed that men in England are more active in doing sports than women, and the younger people spend more time on exercises than the older ones.

46,20_1,aver,./data/best_works/20_1,"The diagram illustrates how many kids in different parts of the world did not have an ability to go to school in two time periods: 2000 and 2012. The horisontal axis shows different regions in two years, whereas the vertical axis shows the number of children in millions. 
At the first glance, it is obvious that in less economically developed regions children are more likely not to get a chance to go to school. As well as that, in all regions in almost both time periods boys had more opportunity to get an education than girls.
As wee can see, in 2000 the least developed region according to the data, was in Africa. There was noticed the biggest number of children without access to primary school education. It was 43,7 millions of people. Besides, in 2012 Africa did not lose its position and counted 32,7 millions of children without an education, which was still the biggest number by this time. In 2000 South Asia was on the second position after Africa, but by 2012 it has become the most educated region with the least number of kids, who had never attended school. That number is 9,9 millions.
AS for the second tendency, in each region almost in each time period boys wer more educated than girls. The biggest difference was noticed in South Asia in 2000, where twice more uneducated girls than boys and that variable was 21,6 millions.

The main trend is that in both 2000 and 2012 more girls than boys still cannot have primary education exept some specific cases like in South Asia in 2012. The most obvious change has occured in South Asia with a fall form 21,6 millions of girls and 11,1 millions of boys in 2000 to 4,8 and 5,1 millions correspondingly. The most poor in primary education regions are still located in Africa. There were some changes in numbers during the period, but they were much slighter than in South Asia. The number of girls without education reduced from 23,7 to 18,2 millions. Also 5,5 millions more of african boys 2012 could have an opportunity to study than in 2000. In the rest of the world the the number of children who can have education have increased since 2000.

It can be noticed that South Asia made the greatest improvement in providing children with education among all other regions. Not only the general number of illiterate children here decreased but also the boys and girls’ proportion significantly changed. Number of children without access to primary education in Africa fell too and that cannot be left without attention.
As it can be seen from the bar chart, there was only approximately 10 millions of children without the access to education in 2012 in South Asia in comparison to about 35 millions in 2000 which means that there used to be almost 3,5 more children unable to enter school in 2000 than 2012. According to the graph, there was approximately 4 times more girls without education which is just about 2 times more than boys in 2000 who did not have a right to have education.
Speaking about Africa, there was a slight improvement in decreasing the number of children with no access to primary schools: almost 5 millions more girls and just over 5 millions of boys were able to get education in 2012 results: the general number insignificantly decreased while boys and girls shares remained stable.

The most significant fall was in South Asia form approximately other tendention: the level of gender discrimination has declined too. In 2000 the number of girls without primary education was 2 times higher than the number of boys, but in 2012 the proportion became approximately equal.
It is clear that the biggest number of children without access to school was in Africa in 2000. It has fallen by 18,2 millions girls and 14,5 millions boys in 2012.

Overall, the main trend is the decrease of number of children of both sexes all over the world. But at the same time the speed of these changes is absolutely different.
As it could be seen from the data, in South Asia the number of uneducated boys became smaller more than a twice. The chart shows that a percentage of uneducated girls in South Asia in 2012 is equal to one-quarter of percentage of uneducated in 2000 and 2012 is the biggest in total in comparison with other countries. If we consider the situation in Africa, we could remark significant changes too. The decrease is not too sharp as in Asia, but it is still remarkable. The number of children of both sexes became smaller for about 5%.
If we speak about the rest of the world, it is obvious that the difference between 2000 and 2012 is about 5% for girls and 3% for boys. To sum up, the bar chart shows significant changes of the number of children in all parts but there is a variety of differencies dependence of region.

Without doubt, Africa has the largest number of children without ability to go to the primary school in both 2000 and 2012 years comparing to the other regions. The most dramatic change have happened in South Asia, where the fall in number of kids was approximately 26 millions: from 2000 to 2012. This dynamic has resulted in the fact that South Asia has less children without chance to have primary school education that in the other regions.
Speaking about gender trends, the given statistics shows us that gender proportion is almost the same in every region in both 2000 and 2012 years exept for the 2000 year in South Asia when the number of girls with the lack of access to the primary school education was twice bigger than the number of boys in the same region.

The interesting fact, that the propotion of boys and girls is aproximately equal, everywhere, exept South Asia in 2000. The number of girls as twice as bigger than boys (21,6 and 11,1). Moreover, South Asia had the smallest number of uneducated children in 2012. That was only 10 millions.
Overall, it is crussialy important that the number of children without access to primary education was decreasing per years. However, Africa in 2012 still has the biggest amount, which is equal to number of children in South Asia in 2000. However, the main trend is positive.

It is obvious that in general the changes throughout the period are positive: the number of children without acess to primary education was dramatically declined. For instance, in South Asia the number of girls without acess to primary education decreased from 21,6% to 4,8%. At the same time, the number of boys changed from 11,1% to 5,1%. In the Africa changes was not so significant, however, the number of children without access to primary education declined from 43,7% to 32,7%.

The highest mark of the number of children without any primary education available was noticed in Africa with 20 millions of boys and 23,7 millions of girls, respectively, making for an insignificant difference between genders in 2000. The lowest rates of uneducated children were spotted in the “Rest of the World” region, with numbers twice as low as in Africa for the same periods of time. Both regions experienced a steady decrease of, approximately, 10 million adolescents over the period with the total of 33 millions and 15 millions for Africa and Rest of the World respectively. The most striking feature is the dynamics for the South Asia region. The number of children with no access to primary education fell dramatically from 33 to 10 million offsprings by the year 2012, which is an absolute minimum for the data given. Besides, the proportion changed greatly with the girls’ number twice as much as the boys’ in 2000 and almost the equal numbers in 2012.

In the beginning of the described period a number of boys with the access to primary education was definetely bigger then a number of girls having such access. For example, in South Asia the number of such boys was approximately two times bigger – almost twenty one and a half millions versus almost eleven millions.

It can be concluded that time spent doing sports generally decreases with age, and that men tend to spend more time on sports than women, with the only exception being age group of 55-64 where women dedicate slightly more time to sporting activities. The peak of sporting activity is observed in men aged 16-24, at nearly 300 minutes, while the smallest figure is found in women over 75 at only 10 minutes. However, men experience a rapid fall in sporting activity at ages 25-34, when the amount of time that is spent on sports is cut almost in half.

So nearly 45 millions of children could not afford education in 2000 in Africa and more than half of that number is established by girls – 23,7 millions to 20 millions of boys.

58,10_2,aver,./data/best_works/10_2,"Today a lot of young families want to be finantialy independent so both parents refer work than to raise their children at home. 
Of course, it happens not because mother and father don’t want to sit with their kids. The main reason is that prices for goods are high so it is necessary for families to have enough money to buy these products. It is obvious that everyone wants to live the full life and not only to get by with. Education of children is also expensive and parents always pay a lot of money for it. What is more, families want to travel on their holidays and go abroad at least once a year. 
It is clear that this kind of lifestyle causes some problems in fostering the children. Firstly, kids do not enough parents` attention, which can lead to psychological problems in the family because children can think that parents simply don`t love them. Secondly, this makes it hard to foster kids. Children spend a lot of time in, for example, kindergarden and take a wide range of habits from other children. Some children are bad behaviored so they can teach others to do the wrong things. And finally, the less time parents spend with children, the harder becomes for them to communicate with each other. It can cause different raws between parents and their kids. 
To sum up, parents in modern families spend less and less time with their children but going out to work is the only way to provide family with all necessary goods.
"
59,11_2,aver,./data/best_works/11_2,"In a huge number of today’s families, mother and father go out to work and their children spend time with parents rarely than they did else some decades ago.
There are some reasons that cause this problem. First of all, parents want to provide an excellent future for their children. Nowadays it’s difficult to reach something in the life without money. So, parents work a lot to earn a huge sums for children’s needs and children’s future. What is more, some people like their jobs That’s why they prefer go to work instead of spend additional time with their children. In addition, some parents have hard, low-paid job and they work more and more only to provide acceptable. Standard of living for children. Such people simply have no opportunity to spend time with their family.
It is easy to find some problems that caused by this reasons. Firstly, children and their parents have no trusting relationships because they don’t spend enough time to gether. Secondly, parents and childrens become strangers to each other. They don’t share problems and joys, they know a little about each other and they cease to be a real family, Finally, when children don’t spend time with their parents they spend it with other people. So, children can get into a bad company and start to smoking drinking or even druging. After it parents can hardly influence on childrens and take them to the right way.
To sum up, when parents and their children don’t spend enough time together their family starts to destroy. So, parents should decide what is more important their work and money or their children. If they choose job it can cause a lot of problems in their family.

They decide to put kids into a kindergarden or ask grandparents for help. Anyway, this decision do not always benefit the children`s fostering and can raise some essential issues. 
Several reasons for such families choice can be suggested. First of all the adults would like to have a high income, therefore they do not want to miss job opportunities if there are some. Secondly such people wish to dain more experience in order to become successful and rich. In this case they will not have to worry about money when they are retired. Finally, some young mothers find it boring to spend all the with babies, nurishing and entertaining them. They decide to make their life brighter and, what is not less important, more independent from their husbends. 
However, such choices lead to situations, when children do not spend enough time with their parents, and it causes following problems. As for the first one, kids suffer from lack of attention and control, and it can result in involving them into troubles, such as street fighting, smoking, drinking alcohol or some criminal issues. Secondly, instead of playing having some delightful discussions with parents, children dedicate all the spare time to computer and any other electronic gadgets. These can influence their mental health and even cause some diseases, such as computer addiction. Finally, if all its members lose interest in daily routine of each other and they fall apart. It can end up with cheating on, different types of depression, misunderstanding and maybe even divorces. 
To sum up the wish if the adults to earn plenty of money is clear and understandable. But they always should remember, that their kids do not appreciate them for dollars and most of times the problems, caused by attention lack, cannot be solved by any finances.

61,14_2,aver,./data/best_works/14_2,"Governments all over the world are thinking about reguling air travels to stop air pollution and global warming. People have different opinions on this problem.
I think that this idea is unnecessary at all. My opinion is that by air travelling people can live everywhere they want and stay in connect with other world. By air anyone can go to other part of the world in 10-15 hours. In the past this way could take much more time.
Als air travel does not need roads or railways. It need only two airports in place A and place B. This is cheaper to build an airport than many kilometers of road. And also I think that other types of transport is harmful too. And planes helps the world to be more open.
But not all people agree with this opinion. Some of them think that planes are very harmful. Planes fly all over the world and over North and South pole. This is one of the ideas why global warming is so big. Also planes pollute air and it is very bad too.
In conclusion I can say that all types os modern transprort are harmful. But planes have many good qualities. So the idea of reguling air transport is not very useful.

One of the reasons of them is a rising amount of air travelling for business and leisure activities. Some people believe that government should decrease air flights by introducing strict laws, while others are not agree with this idea.
As for me, I strongly disagree with this idea. First of all, according to the statistic much more poisonous gas and exhaust fumes are produced by cars, due to this fact it will be more useful to introduce more laws for reducing amount of cars which is constantly rising nowadays.
Moreover, reducing the amount of air flights will cause some kind of economic crises for air flight companies and influence the number of people who will start use their private transport such as cars, and using of trains and ferries is also will increase. However, this kinds of transport produce more waste in the atmosphere. As a result, this laws for reducing air travel will not be effective and useful for the environment and will lead to crisis.
However, decreasing of number air travel will lead to some positive effects as more strict rules for technical equipment of planes, as a result, air flights will become not only more nature friendly, but also safier for passengers.
In conclusion, I must say that reducing the amount of air travel by introducing laws be government is a quite useless idea which will not help to decrease air pollution or global warming significantly, but will lead to serious economic problems all over the world.

63,16_2,aver,./data/best_works/16_2,"Nowadays the humanity try to solve more and more serious problems. One of them is a rapid growth of air pollution and global warming caused by increased number of travelling by air. There is a belief that the amount of air travel should be controlled and decreased by governments. As far as I concerned, I consider this idea to be irrelevant in today’s world for the following reasons.
To begin with, it is a very difficult to decide which air travels are necessary and which are not. It is almost impossible to create such organization or a law that will explain why this or that travel must be canceled. Introduction of this laws will probably cause negative moods in the socity. We cannot abandon all the leisure travels but if they are reduced everyone must have the same rights.
What is more, most of the business trips must be done as soon as possible. It usually has a great impact on peoples’ life conditions since a lot of projects and contracts are connected with humans’ difficult to mind of how a persons from the US and Japan for example will do their business without travelling between their countries.
Besides, from my point of view, problems caused by air travel must be dealt with. But it is up to the government to find a solution not in decreasing the number of flights but in improving technologies which reduce the consequences caused by a plane.
In conclusion, the problems of polluting the air and global warming still exist. Nevertheless, everyday air travelling strongly affects the humanity and the decision to decrease the amount of it will probably solve environmental problems but will cause more social issues.

64,17_2,aver,./data/best_works/17_2,"It is believed by some that people should travel using plane only due to emergency cases. Otherwise, we should not be allowed to us planes as they contaminate our environment. I completely disagree with this statement. In my opinion, planes is one of the greatest inventions in the history and we should take the best out of it.
First of all, planes is fastest way to travel to other countries. Nowadays, people just cannot afford themselves spending days and weeks on travelling by cars or ships. It is too long and they are too busy to waste time on such long journeys. What is more, with globalization, the world is changing very quickly and innovations in one country have immediate effects on others. This is why business trips should be fast, so that people had the chance to adapt to changes properly.
However, some people are certain that air travels have disasterous effect on environment condition. Nobody can argue that, but in fact, cars, ships and other means of transport do as much harm to nature as planes. If we compare a plane for 150 passengers and 150 personal cars, it is clear that the first option is better. Another argument against planes is a huge possibility of air crash. However, statistics proves that plane is the safest kind of transport.
To summarize, I would like to say that although a huge plane seems the biggest threat to our environment, in reality, it is not. Furthermore, air travel is the safest and fastes way to reach the destination.

65,18_2,aver,./data/best_works/18_2,"Nowadays it is common for both parents to have a full-time job. Hence, children don’t receive as much attention as they used before.
There are some reasons why parents choose work instead of spending time with their child. First of all, if both parents have a job, it significantly increases the budget of the family. It allows them to spend more money on vital things for children such as good education. Secondly, women usually are eager to get back to their jobs and climbing career ladder after spending early years of child at home. In such cases parents usually leave their child to close relatives or to a private nanny. There is also an option when a child can stay in school or kinder garden until the evening.
However, leaving children and lowering the attention received by them from parents can lead to some significant problems, especially if it happens during early childhood. To start with, if the child is used to be very close to parents, such sudden lack of their attention can cause psycological problems. It is a hard chellange for a child to start spending some time without parents nearby. In addition, in case when parents don’t talk to their children often and are not interested in their concerns, children might build a strong opinion that parents don’t love them and don’t care about them. It can lead not only to broken relationship between parents and children in future but to many childhood fears and self-inconfidence as well.
In conclusion, it is an often situation when both parents go out to work. Sometimes they just don’t have a choice in order to provide the family with all needed goods and facilities. Although it is a normal situation, it should be done very carefully as such actions of parents can affect children roughly.

66,19_2,aver,./data/best_works/19_2,"National governments nowadays are seriously concerned about air travelling due to high levels of air pollution and effect called global warming, thatswhy they have to decide whether they should invent laws to decrease the number of flights or find another solvation.
On one hand, great amount of air travel is damaging nature every day, not only because they consume huge number of resources, such as fuel, oil, but also because of poisoned gas and waist thrown into the air. Moreover, some people say that air travel in many cases is unnecessary, because we have lots of other ways of transport. In addition, this type of travel cause serious and dangerous long-term outcomes, especially global warming, hence contemporary governments have to take measures to prevent future disasters and destruction of the nature.
On the other hand, introducing new laws to reduce the usage of air transport significantly seem to be too strict and not adequate to the situation, because it is still the fastest and the most comfortable way of moving from one place to another. Consequently, we have to focus not only on trying to decrease number of flights, using laws, but also on saving nature in general, taking actions against every source of pollution. Moreover, there are lots of alternative ways in solving problem of air pollution, except making laws: for example, finding new efficient sources of energy or improving air cleaning systems, or even making engines more efficient and less polluting. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that the best solution is to improve effectiveness of engines and to make the amount of gas thrown into the atmosphere fall down, until we find a new way of transportation, which would be faster, more comfortable and less damaging to our planet. To add, I think that appropriate option is to find a way to improve present transport, but not to get rid of it.

67,1_2,aver,./data/best_works/1_2,"There are different point of views on what the main functions of social networks are. While some says the social media should provide various types of information and improve knowledge of people in different spheres, the opinion that websites such as Facebook or Vkontakte were created only for entertainment also exists. I would rather agree with the first point of view.
First of all, social networks are good tools for education. They are open to everyone which means people can share their own knowledge with others, download some useful books and materials access to which is usually limited, discuss problems and find their solutions together. Interacting with other people, many of whom have a high level of intellect and a considerable amount of life experience, can give a person an opportunity to improve his own knowledge. Besides, exchange of opinions on the certain matter during discussions in social networks can help people to find mistakes in their theories and develop it.
Another important feature which should be taken into account is that Facebook and Vkontakte usually provide much more information about recent events than official news websites and, thus, are very useful those who want to find out more details.
Of course, it must not be forgotten that for most people social networks are only entertainment resources. Many of ordinary citizens claim that they discussed enough serious matters at work, and at home, sitting in front of the computer, they just want to relax. Nobody would denies that social networks provide a great range of games, movies and other types of entertainment. Still, I would argue that the main purpose of Facebook and Vkontakte is providing information as it is necessary for everyone to know about what is happening in the world.
Having said that, although. entertainment and sharing of knowledge are both very important functions of social media, the last one seems to be more important for modern people.

68,20_2,aver,./data/best_works/20_2,"Evidence seems to suggest that the dispute about the effectiveness and environmental usefullness of the air travelling is extremely merit. There are plenty of people and authorities who are absolutely sure that modern society can easily exist without travelling by plane. Moreover, reducing the air travelling will lead to saving the environment. I absolutely do not agree with that the statement and now I am going to consider my point of view.
Firstly, air travelling is the fastest kind of transport by present day. Great number of people use it every day to get to the destination, which may be extremely far from their homes. What is more, people us planes not only for their targets, a lot of business trips happen each day. And can you imagine the situation, when have to have a deal on millions of dollars US, and the should spend some days or maybe weeks to meet with their partners. As a result, the economy of many countries can be damaged greatly as well.
Secondly, if governments reduce the number of air travels, there is no doubt that soon they will find an increase in using other kinds of transport, which are not less environmentally harmful as planes, like cars, trains, buses and so on. It is obvious that all these transport can be as damaging for the nature, as planes do, or maybe ever more.
And finally, governments risk to meet with dissatisfied people, as the reducing the flights means the increasing costs on other transport and disability of people to get to place in the latest way.
To sum up, I would like to say that surely air travelling is dangerous for the nature and soon it will appear in great problems for the mankind. However, we should not recognize that as the only one factor and concentrate on what is, obviously, supposed to be the best and most modern way of travelling on long distances.

69,21_2,aver,./data/best_works/21_2,"Some people claim that travelling by air leads to environmental problems, so governments should prohibit such an enormous amount of flights. It is a kind of very controversial question, that is why I can only partly agree with this statement.
First of all, taking care of environmental is important, but it should not harm the process of maintaining economical stability and communication all over the world. Air travel provides lots of opportunities for business and helps people to stay in touch with other parts of the world. By reducing a huge amount of flights some really serious problems with transportation may occure. Also this fact can cause the loss of governmental budgets and citizens’ unsatisfaction. Such economical unstability and problems with transportation of people and goods an lead to crisis and serious lack of money.
Furthermore, planes contribute to less air pollution than, for instance, cars and other vechicles. In order to save less poisoned air governments have to create some laws to make people use private cars less instead of making laws to reduce the number of air transportations. Also modern planes become more and more environment-friendly, so using them in nearest future would not be as harmful as it seems.
To sum up, I only partly agree that planes contribute to great air pollution. Also I strongly believe that governments should not introduce laws to reduce air travelling.

Some people believe that governments have to minimize the amount air travel in order to save ecology while I believe that it is not necessary and, moreover, not enough to protect our planet: from dangerous pollution.
Firstly, aircrafts are simply not the greatest danger our planet ecology face. There are around 50000 flight registered every day which is few times less than the number of car trips completed. It leads to a thought that it would be smarter to manage and regulate car usage which woutd minimize pollution rather than introducing laws to reduce air traffic.
Secondly, technological innovations have to be taken into consideration too. World’s most famous enterprises that produce airplanes spend millions of dollars in order to achieve higher results in eco-friendly engineering. This means that aircrafts, used in transporting people, produce less air pollution than the ones that were used years ago and all measures required are taken in order to follow international standarts of ecological production aimed to safe our planet.
To conclude, governments have to concentrate, on same more serious sources of global warming and air pollution rather than just sticking to one insignificant source and leaving unnoticed most dangerous ones.

71,23_2,aver,./data/best_works/23_2,"I could not agree more that air travel is one of the cause of global warming and air pollution because of its greenhouse gases. However, I think that government regulation of this public transport hits the liberty. Let us analyze everything in detail.
First of all, there are basic human rights which say that any travel should be free, despite the purposes. It means that authoritys could not order which travel is unnecessary. For example, statistics shows that about 50% of people all over the world have very hard work, so they need continious rest. In this case it is illegal to ban rases to resorts.
In addition, I believe that the majority of modern countries are democratic. Consequently, the government has not power to introduce such radical laws without public discussions. For instance, in Australia the authorityes got an idea to change the national flag in 2009. But many cityzens were agains and after voting it was saved the old flag.
On the other hand, my opponents argue that it is very dangerous to the natural environment to allow huge amount of air travel. I can not agree with that at all. I believe that the main cause of air pollution is greenhouse gases from our cars. Airplane is very expensive machine, so the amount of them is quite little in the world. However, there are thousands and thousans cars in our streets.
All things considered, I strongly believe that governments shouldn’t introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel.
"
72,24_2,aver,./data/best_works/24_2,"Nowadays people travel by plane every day but this process lead to pollution of the atmosphere. Some people are sure that it is necessary to limit the number of fights using such instrument as laws. I disagree this point of view that laws about reducing the number of air travelers could help us save the nature and particulary the fresh air.
First, we should not forget that planes are not the only transport which put dangerous gases in the atmosphere. There are a lot of cars, buses, etc. using oil and producing CO2. OF course, someone could argue that it is too difficult to decrease the number of cars on roads, because they are so necessary in our everyday life and we could not imagine our life without it. However, I strongly believe, that we could find a new solution as electronic cars or any other type of ecological cars.
The other reason to not limit air travel for business and leisure is the support of economics. Air flights nowadays are integrated in multiple business processes and the reducing of the amount of air travel could cause unexpected negative effect. Some people support the idea of replacing air travel by sea travel and they think this action will have a good influence on atmosphere. Despite the fact of decrease of air pollution, the new type of impact on nature will appear. This impact called sea pollution will affect on sea animals and humans living near the cost.
Moreover, governments will face with difficulties with creations of this new law as it is quite problematic to decide which category of population could fly and which could not. Scientists may remark that there are many specialists in laws, statistics and logistics who’s work is to solve such problems. But I suppose, that population reaction will be unpredictable too.
In conclusion, I  would say that flights limit is not the better way to reduce air pollution and make our atmosphere fresher. I think there are many alternative steps to avoid increasing of negative effect of human activities in nature. People should respect the nature but it does not mean they should not use airplanes.

73,25_2,aver,./data/best_works/25_2,"It is a well known fact that in our modern word ecology is one of the most important global issues. And one of the most dangerous problems existing are undoubtedly air pollution and global warming which are the effects of many world processes, for example, it has been proved that air travel would lead to those dramatic problems. There is a widely spread opinion that government structures should control the number of air travel by the power of law, but from my personal point of view it is not the most effective solution to this problem.
First of all, although it is true that in our time we have a huge amount of unnecessary air travel incidents, it could be very difficult to establish an international law that will control the number of flights. Most of the flights are happening when people want to visit other countries and because of that it is important to make almost every country in the world to agree with such politics, which is almost impossible. 
Secondly, this solution to the global warming and air pollution problem caused by air travel is not the only one. Governments could reduce air pollution by investing in science in order to make more ecological fuels. This method could solve the problem without difficulties with law in different countries.
To conclude, I want to say that even though making the law sounds like an incredible solution to solving the global problems but it is so just in theory. In practice there are more effective and easy ways to handle that issue.
"
74,26_2,aver,./data/best_works/26_2,"Nowadays, air travel can be the cause of air pollution and global warming, that is why goverments could create laws, which will reduce the amount of air travel.
I am agree with the previous statement for several reasons. First of all, enviremental problems becoming more and more significant every year. Goverment should do everything and make all necessary measures to safe our planet. There are a lot of different types of transport, which can replace the airplanes.
Moreover, there is no doubt that airplane is one of the fastest way of travelling, but at the same time it is one of most dangerous. I believe, that the majority of people will prefer the train instead the plane, if goverment explain the danger of airplanes. For instance, goverment can introduce the law to reduce the amount of air travel, but also, make modern trains, which will be fast and more comfortable.
Finaly, in my opinion, not only planes is the cause of air pollution. Different factories, which make airplanes, also «guilty» in pollution of air. If the number of planes will decreased, many factories could be closed. It is also can help.
In conclusion, I would like to say, that this law is a necessary measure, which could help to avoid some enviremental problems such as global warming and air pollution.
"
75,27_2,aver,./data/best_works/27_2,"Nowadays a lot of people argue about air travel. Some of them are sure that the amount of air travel should be reduced as it caused air pollution and global warming. However, others are claim that is not the most crucial problem.
I support the first point if view for a variety of reasons. First of all, air pollution, which is caused by the enormous amount of air travel, is the reason of global warming. A lot of countries are suffering from the consequences of it, trying to find the way to stop it. The problem is that the one country cannot deal with global warming alone. The all world should pay attention on how air travel is harmful for our planet. Moreover, people should think about the alternative ways of travel, which can be more harmless. Besides, scientists can create less harmful and polluted types of planes.
However, other people are sure that air travel is the least way of travelling. They claim that air travel is the fastest and the safest. There are more car accidents per year than the plane crashes. Also, they are strongly confident that it will be very expensive to create a new type off plane. They are sure that it is better to spend money on more important problems, like hunger and economical crisis.
I do not agree with this point of view because we cannot safe money on essential problems like global warming. People should try to help poorer countries to survive. I agree that the hunger is also one of the most crucial problems. But I am sure that it does not mean that people should forget about the others.
In conclusion, I am strongly confident that people should be very careful with the global problems as they influence not only our planet, but also the mankid.

76,29_2,aver,./data/best_works/29_2,"Air travel has been proven to contribute greatly to air pollution and global warming. As a lot of air travel is unnecessary, governments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
It has already been concluded by scientists that aircraft produces too much CO2 emissions and destroys our environment. Some people would advice government to regulate the number of most popular flights to prevent the climate disaster. Others consider this idea useless and impossible and so do I.
First of all, after reducing the amount of business and touristic air travel any government will not be able to provide some transport instead and save the level of convinience. People will not be ready to sacrifice their time and comfort and, for example, travel 9 hours by train instead of flying for 1,5 hours.
Secondly, such suggestion would be a direct affact on the people’s freedom and liberty. In modern society everyone has a right to move and travel to any place by any legal transport.
Thirdly, the regulation activities in the sphere of air travelling will lead to the decline in the level of economy. A lot of people working in the air companies and touristic field will loose their jobs because of the decrease in the demand.
All the things considered, I strongly believe that the reduce in the amount of some air travel will have more negative impact on people than positive impact on the environment. That is why I would suggest to support the science to solve the problem of pollution inventing new ecological technologies.

77,30_2,aver,./data/best_works/30_2,"Shipping cargo and the passengers by airplanes leads to polluting the atmosphere and the raise of temperature all over the world, so must be taken laws for the reducing the number of air travel for business and tourism activities. In this essay both arguments will be introduced on this topic.
Some say that we should reduce the number of the flights to save our planet and ecology. Carbon dioxide which is thrown in the atmosphere by planes causes global warming and ice melting and planes produce most of it, so less planes means less pollution. However, cars produce much more CO’s in total but nobody talks about banning them.
Others have strong belief that rulling air travel industry by government will cause a decline in a number of companies connected with that field of economy. They claim that for same undeveloped countries tourism is the only way of earning the money as for the businessman as for the government budget, so by these eco-laws the economics will crush in logistics, tourism and other sectors, but they forget  that our planet’s resources are not timeless and now we face the problem of the existing of our environment which is more important than the economy.
As for me, I tend to believe that the best way to solve this problem is to find alternative sources of energy and to make eco-friendly techologies. For example, electric planes which wouldn’t harm the planet.
All in all, the question of government rulling in air travelling is not the easiest one, so each country should decide for itself what is better, but personally I think that developing safe technologies is the best solution, but until it becomes common to humanity. We mustn’t regulate the number of flights and harm economics.

First of all, we should understand, that the way, how we express our opinion shouldn't hert anybody.

Of course our government should represent all points of view on all problems, which exist in our society, and for this reason government can define the limits of our expression.
